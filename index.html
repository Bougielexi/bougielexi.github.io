        <h2>A Little About Myself</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Lexi. I'm in the Software Developer program at FVTC. Some things I enjoy doing include playing video games, going for walks, reading, spending time
            with my family, making perlers, going to music festivals and shows, and baking. Some of my favorite video games are Skyrim, The Last of Us, Animal Crossing, and multiple Zelda games.
            I enjoy reading science fiction and fantasy books. My favorite places to go for walks would be anywhere near the water and state parks. I enjoy making perlers,
            which are little beads you can make pixel art with and melt with an iron. Lately I've enjoyed baking cinnamon rolls but try to resist making them too frequently.</p>

        <p>I have 2 cats. Both are boys, and one is a grey tabby while the other is black with some white patches on his stomach. My grey cat's name is Scotch,
            and my black cat's name is Thackery, after the cat from Hocus Pocus.</p>
